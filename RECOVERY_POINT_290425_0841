Amazon Seller Memorial Products - Project Summary
Date: April 29, 2025

Project Overview
This is an automated memorial product design and order management system handling orders across Amazon EU/US/AU, Etsy, and eBay platforms. The system is being enhanced with AI capabilities using Llama 3.2-1B for quality assurance and inventory analysis.

Current Status
Core Components
Product Design Automation
SVG generation system for memorial products
Support for multiple stake types (regular, colored, large)
Color variations including 'stone' and 'marble'
Order Management
Multi-platform order processing
Zenstores integration for shipping
Pending Amazon SP-API integration
AI Integration (In Progress)
Local Llama 3.2-1B model for:
Design file quality assurance
Inventory analysis
Order validation
Model path: C:/Users/zentu/.llama/checkpoints/Llama3.2-1B/
Recent Updates
Modified LlamaInterface class to use llama-cpp-python
Installed Visual Studio Build Tools and Git
Updated model loading and response generation code
Configured local model paths
Known Issues
Selective row skipping in output.csv based on filter criteria
Awaiting Amazon SP-API access
Need logging implementation for skipped rows
Technical Environment
Python 3.11+
Production Methods: CNC, Laser, UV, Sublimation
Build Tools: Visual Studio Build Tools, Git
Pending: llama-cpp-python installation
Detailed Next Steps
1. Complete AI Integration (Immediate Priority)
Install llama-cpp-python:
Open new PowerShell session (for Git PATH)
Run py -3.11 -m pip install llama-cpp-python
Verify installation
Test AI Components:
Design Analysis:
Test with sample design files
Verify QA feedback format
Validate issue detection
Inventory Analysis:
Test with current inventory data
Verify reorder recommendations
Check sales velocity insights
Order QA:
Test with sample orders
Verify validation rules
Check error handling
2. System Improvements
Implement Logging:
Add logging for skipped rows in output.csv
Create log rotation system
Define log levels and messages
SP-API Integration:
Follow up on API access
Prepare integration code
Plan testing strategy
3. Documentation & Maintenance
Document AI Integration:
Update technical documentation
Create user guides
Document model parameters
Environment Maintenance:
Keep requirements.txt updated
Monitor virtual environment
Regular dependency updates
4. Future Enhancements
Consider additional stake types
Expand color variations
Optimize model performance
Enhance error handling
Immediate Action Items
